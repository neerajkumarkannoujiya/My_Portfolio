OOP makes the complete program simpler by dividing it into a number of objects. The objects can be used as a bridge to have data flow from one function to another. We can easily modify data and function as per the requirement. Hence learning about OOPs concepts makes a very important step in learning Java.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about OOPs concepts in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concept in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Classes and Objects in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real-life entities and Java Programming. It means that to implement anything in Java, Classes and objects are made. This article will give you an insight about Classes and Objects and also help you relate it to the real world.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Classes and Objects in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Classes and Objects in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Constructors in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;In Order to efficiently use Classes and Objects, one needs to know about the Constructors in Java. Constructors are used to initialize the object&rsquo;s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Constructors in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Constructors in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/methods-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Methods in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods allow us to reuse the code without retyping the code. In Java, every method must be part of some class which is different from languages like C, C++ and Python. Methods are time savers and help us to reuse the code without retyping the code. This not only makes methods an important part of Java but also a must learn topic for learners.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Methods in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/methods-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Methods in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strings-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Strings in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Strings are defined as an array of characters. Java, unlike other programming languages, provides a very easy implementation of Strings which can be learnt even by a beginner. Hover over this mentioned article to learn in depth about the Strings in Java.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Strings in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strings-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Strings in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Arrays in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++. To know more, refer the mentioned article.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Arrays in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Arrays in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Collections in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;A Collection is a group of individual objects represented as a single unit. Java provides Collection Framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a group of objects as a single unit. Java Collection Framework is not the most important part in learning Data Structures and Algorithms, but also it is the most useful module in a programming language\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Collections in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Collections in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generics-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Generics in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Generics in Java is similar to templates in C++. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, &hellip; etc and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes and interfaces. For example, classes like HashSet, ArrayList, HashMap, etc use generics very well. We can use them for any type. So not only Generics makes a very important asset in programming, but it also makes the backbone of writing efficient code as well.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Generics in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generics-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Generics in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stream-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stream In Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that support various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result. Though this was introduced later in Java, it has gained huge importance in the Java programming very quickly. To be able to work on data fluently in Java, one must learn about the Streams.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Stream In Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stream-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stream In Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exceptions-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions and Exception Handling in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Many a times in the learning of Java till now, you must have come across the word &ldquo;EXCEPTION&rdquo;. An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program&rsquo;s instructions. So to develop a module that does not break, one has to learn how to handle exceptions.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Exceptions and Exception Handling in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exceptions-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions and Exception Handling in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regular-expressions-in-java/\">Regular Expressions (ReGex) in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Though this word might seem new to you, Regular Expression is a very important part of Development. Regular Expressions or Regex (in short) is an API for defining String patterns that can be used for searching, manipulating and editing text. It is widely used to define a constraint on strings such as a password.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Regular Expressions here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regular-expressions-in-java/\">Regular Expressions (ReGex) in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Multithreading in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such a program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process. Though this might seem difficult at first, its a very important part of concurrent programming in Java.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Multithreading in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Multithreading in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-handling-in-java-with-crud-operations/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">File Handling in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Java too supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on files. The concept of file handling has stretched over various other languages, but the implementation is either complicated or lengthy, but alike other concepts of Java, this concept here is also easy and short.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about File Handling in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-handling-in-java-with-crud-operations\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">File Handling in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packages-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Packages in Java</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces. In other words, a package in Java refers to a collection of classes, interfaces, abstract classes, and exceptions that will help in a module in Java programming.\r\n\t<p><strong>Learn about Packages in Java here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packages-in-java/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Packages in Java</a></strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>",

It is used to design web pages using the&nbsp;<strong>markup language</strong>. HTML is the combination of&nbsp;<strong>Hypertext</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Markup language</strong>. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"HTML Tutorial\" src=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20220401124017/HTML-Tutorial.png\" style=\"height:439px; width:1000px\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is HTML used for ?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>HTML is used to create the structure of web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web (www). It contains Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HTML Basic Format Page Structure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"HTML Basic Format\" src=\"https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20220401160946/HTML-Basic-Format.png\" style=\"height:695px; width:1000px\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-doctypes/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;DOCTYPE! html&gt;</a>&nbsp;&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-html-tag/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-head-tag/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;head&gt;</a>&nbsp;&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-body-tag/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;body&gt;</a>&nbsp;&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example 1:&nbsp;</strong>This is the basic example of HTML that display the heading and paragraph content.</p>",
